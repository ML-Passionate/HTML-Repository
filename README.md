# HTML Repository

The `index.html` file serves as a comprehensive repository of HTML commands, covering essential elements for structuring and styling web content. It includes basic structure tags like `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>`; text formatting elements such as `<h1>` to `<h6>`, `<p>`, `<strong>`, `<em>`, and `<br>`; links and images with `<a>` and `<img>`; lists using `<ul>`, `<ol>`, and `<li>`; forms with `<form>`, `<input>`, and `<button>`; tables with `<table>`, `<tr>`, `<td>`, and `<th>`; semantic elements like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<nav>`; and other elements such as `<div>`, `<span>`, and `<iframe>`. Each command is accompanied by a description and an example to illustrate its usage. This repository is a valuable resource for learning and referencing HTML commands.
